<br><strong>A detective</strong> investigating a man's death in the mountains meets the dead man's <strong><u>mysterious wife</u></strong> in the course of his dogged sleuthing.</br>

<br><p style="margin-top:40px;">Phantom Thread but it takes place in South Korea</p>
I don't get why this film scores higher than Park's old boy and the handmaiden. The cinematography is the only outstanding thing in this film. The story is not complicated and deep enough to fit into the 2 hour and a half timeframe. The twisted love seems similar to Phantom Thread, but that film has better screenplay and performance than this one.</br>
